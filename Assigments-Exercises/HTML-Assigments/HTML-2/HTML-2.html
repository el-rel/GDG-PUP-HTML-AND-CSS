    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hi, I'm Rel! I'm an accountancy student with a knack for numbers, but my interests go far beyond finance. I love diving into history, literature, and filmmaking—whether it's exploring the National Museum’s exhibits or perfecting the color grading in my film projects (which I’m still working on!).</p>

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>

    <p>I have a keen interest in financial tracking, where I organize my expenses, cash flow, and financial goals in Excel—it’s satisfying to make sense of numbers. Filmmaking and video editing also captivate me, especially when experimenting with transitions, flashback scenes, and improving my color grading skills. Beyond that, I enjoy delving into history and literature, particularly how indigenous Filipino communities expressed themselves before the advent of science. My curiosity extends to technology and programming as well, blending logic with creativity through digital projects. I also love visiting museums, exploring cultural exhibits, and analyzing artifacts that tell the story of Filipino heritage.</p>
